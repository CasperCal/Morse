# Morse

Small for fun project that translates any sentence to morse code.

# Usage

Only works for alphanumerical characters and spaces.

Just compile it and enter a string after - the program only takes on argument, so format it as ./morse "here goes your string"

If you want to enter a !, use single quotes('') or your shell will break.

Program return 0 if it could not read the entire string and 1 if it could.
